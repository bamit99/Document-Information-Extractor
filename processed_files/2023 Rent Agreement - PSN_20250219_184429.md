Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this rental agreement. Let me read through it carefully first.

Okay, so the agreement is between Amit Bajpai and Amit Bhatnagar in Bangalore. It's for an apartment measuring 1418 sq ft with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The lease starts on 1st December 2023 and ends on 31st October 2024, so that's 11 months.

The rent is Rs. 42,000 per month, excluding maintenance charges. There's also a refundable security deposit of Rs. 1,75,000. The tenant has to pay this by online transfer. Rent is due within the first 7 days of each month.

If either party wants to renew the contract after these 11 months, there will be a 7% increase in the rental amount.

The tenant is responsible for paying electricity and cooking gas bills. Other maintenance charges like PSAOWA are handled by the landlord.

The apartment can only be used for residential purposes and the tenant isn't allowed to sublet or transfer the agreement. The landlord can enter the premises during regular hours for inspections.

The tenant must keep the property in good condition and repair any damages caused. They can make non-structural alterations with the landlord's permission. No storing hazardous goods or causing disturbances to neighbors.

Tenant must follow society rules. Either party can terminate the lease with 30 days' notice. At the end of the lease, the tenant returns the apartment in its current condition minus normal wear and tear. The security deposit is refunded after deducting any unpaid rent.

The landlord painted and cleaned the place before handing it over. If the tenant doesn't maintain this condition or repaints, one month's rent from the security deposit will be deducted.

There are provisions for reporting major issues to the landlord via phone and help desk; the builder handles those repairs.

Annexure I lists the furniture and appliances included in the premises.

I think the user wants a concise summary without all the legal jargon. They might need this for quick reference or sharing terms with someone else. Maybe they're looking to understand what's covered before signing or as a reminder.

I should structure it clearly, breaking down each section like parties involved, property details, term, rent, security deposit, responsibilities, etc. Make sure key points are highlighted so it's easy to read and understand.

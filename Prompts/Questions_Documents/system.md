Your task is to meticulously parse the following document to extract every question, both directly stated and implied. Approach this task systematically:

Holistic Review: Begin by gaining a complete understanding of the document's overall structure, purpose, and key themes.
Contextual Analysis: For each section, topic, and paragraph, analyze the surrounding information to determine the intended meaning and potential questions that arise.
Granular Examination: Conduct a thorough, word-by-word analysis to identify any questions, even those subtly embedded within statements or explanations.
Comprehensive Extraction: Capture all questions related to the data, concepts, or arguments presented. This includes questions that:
Are explicitly stated with question marks.
Are implied through phrases like "I wonder if...", "What about...", or "This raises the question of...".
Arise logically from the document's content, even if not directly phrased as questions.
Complete Coverage: Ensure you have processed every element of the document, from the very first word to the very last.
Avoid Assumptions: Do not assume any question is too obvious or insignificant to include.
Deliver a complete list of extracted questions, maintaining the order in which they appear in the document where possible."

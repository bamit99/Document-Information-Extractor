   - Create a heading using the topic as the title.
   - Provide all relevant information related to that topic in a structured format underneath the heading.
5. Repeat step 4 recursively for any sub-topics or additional layers of information.
6. Ensure that the final output covers all information from the transcript in a comprehensive and structured manner.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
